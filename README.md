```python
class SoftwareEngineer:
     def __init__(self) -> None:
         self.__name = "Rohil Varma"
         self.__role = "Software Engineer"
         self.__company = "Deloitte Inida (Offices of the US)"

     def say_hi(self) -> None:
         print("Thanks for dropping by, hope you find some of my work interesting.")

me: SoftwareEngineer = SoftwareEngineer()
me.say_hi()
```
